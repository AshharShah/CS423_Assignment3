# DevOps Assignment 4 - Terraform (AWS)

Note: The only thing required for running these Terraform files is that we will
need to configure our AWS user cridentials using the `aws configure` command that is provided
by the AWS CLI (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html). We
can create an IAM User, provide it administrator level access and use its credentials or use the 
root users credentails. (It is not prefered to use the root user).
